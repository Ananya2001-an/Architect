The Facial Recognition Overlay component in the Public Safety System might require advanced machine learning skills and could be challenging to implement within the given timeframe. 3. The Energy Consumption Chart component and Renewable Energy Contribution component in the Smart Energy Grid feature require complex data visualization and might be difficult to implement within the given timeframe. 4. The Urban Farming feature involves a Pest Prediction Alerts component, which might require advanced machine learning skills and could be challenging to implement within the given timeframe. 5. The E-Government Portal feature involves an Identity Verification component, which might require complex integration with third-party services and could be challenging to implement within the given timeframe.\"}\n"
